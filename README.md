Introducing HubHealth, a **Clinic Appointment Management System** designed to empower **Singaporean clinic
receptionists** to **manage patient information** and **schedule appointments** efficiently. As a clinic receptionist,
you can easily manage patient records (including name, birthdate, contact information, etc.) and track past and
upcoming appointments with simple keyboard commands. Additionally, the **tagging system** allows you to tag
government-related subsidies (such as CHAS) or insurance information to your patient, simplifying patient management.

* If you are interested in using HubHealth, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing HubHealth, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
